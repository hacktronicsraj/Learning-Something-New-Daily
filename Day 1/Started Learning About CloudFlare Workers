Started Learning About CloudFlare Workers

I learned about cloudflare workers and how server less functions work , and I also learnt very few thing about aws lambda functions and similarities between cloudflare workers and lambda functions ,

I always wanted to make my own notification system for reminding things that I forget to do

First I thought about twilio and backed out because of the bills and some complications I faced creating a account so then I found out about NTFY.sh then I made my own ntfy server using their docker image and deployed it to azure ,

so now I combined lambda functions with my ntfy server , at first I faced some challanges on package managers and so I made some additional layers for the function and It somewhat worked so now I am going to fix that and experiment more with lambda functions triggers and learn about web hooks
